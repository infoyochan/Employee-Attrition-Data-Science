# Employee Attrition Analysis Using Data Science

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition (employee turnover) using data science techniques.
The goal is to understand key factors that influence employees leaving a company and to build
a simple predictive model to support HR decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on employee data
- Identify factors related to employee attrition
- Build a basic machine learning model (Logistic Regression)
- Provide business insights for HR strategy

## 📊 Dataset
- IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
- Each row represents one employee
- Target variable: **Attrition** (Yes = left, No = stayed)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Data exploration and descriptive statistics
- Visualization of attrition vs:
  - Monthly income
  - Overtime
  - Job satisfaction
- Data preprocessing (label encoding)
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation

## 💡 Key Insights
- Employees with lower income tend to have higher attrition
- Overtime is strongly associated with employee attrition
- Lower job satisfaction increases the likelihood of leaving
